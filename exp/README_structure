This README describes the structure of every experiment directory.

It is important to follow a few simple rules, in order to be able to
understand and reproduce our experiments.

Each subdirectory corresponds to a single experiment, done at a
precise time. The name of each directory should contain the date it
was created and indicate what the experiment is about.

Within each experiment directory, we need to have the following
subdirectories.

- A subdirectory data contains the data specific to this experiment,
  that are not located in the general data directory located at the
  root of the github repo. For example, if we do an experiment on
  simulated data, these simulated data should be in this directory. If
  we reuse the same data (e.g. simulated data) in several experiments,
  then we can use symbolic links toward the correspondign directories,
  but this reauire we are very strict on the fact that the data have
  not been modified sicne they were generated).

- A subdirectory src contains the sources of the program we used for
  the experiment that are not external programs that are already in
  the directory src at the root of the github repo. This should in
  particular contain the sources of our programs (i.e. the
  programs/scripts we wrote) used in the experiment.

- A subdirectory results should contain the results of the experiment.

- A subdirectory doc should contain the notebooks describing precisely
  the experiment and the analysis of the results of the experiment.

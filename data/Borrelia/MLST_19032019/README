Alleles. Each file XXXX.fasta contains th sequences of the alleles for
the locus XXXX. There are 8 loci: clpA, clpX, nifS, pepX, pyrG, recG,
rplB, uvrA. The alleles sequences were obtained from
https://pubmlst.org/bigsdb?db=pubmlst_borrelia_seqdef&page=downloadAlleles

Alignments.  We aligned the alleles of each locus using muscle and
MAFFT. For locus XXXX,
- the file XXXX_muscle.fasta (resp. XXXX_muscle.clw) contains the
alignment of the alleles in FASTA format (resp. clustalw) using
muscle, obtained from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/ on March
19, 2019 using the default options;
- the file XXXX_mafft.fasta contains the alignment of the alleles in
FASTA formatusing muscle, obtained from
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/mafft/ on March 19, 2019 using the
default options.
